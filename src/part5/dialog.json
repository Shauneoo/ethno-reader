It could deceive tourists into thinking about that it was made in the 18 th century. Some people would say that this is dishonest or inauthentic, that a more contemporary style should be used. It is also contentious to erect such a statue of a man at a time when there is a growing realisation that too few women from history or current times have been commemorated. Is it appropriate to fill the city with more statues of white men? Young women today want to see role models more relevant to them. It may als be contentious in that it's location required another existing statue to be relocated to face the new one. Some people feel that it was not appropriate to do thA. The statue of William Chamber is somehow diminished by the new scheme. It previously dominated the street ( as it was designed/ intended to do. I also find the materials and size ( and choice of sculptor) contentious as it was very expensive. It was commissioned by a few wealthy and influential men in this city.
