New work has to recognise its place in the city as it was, currently is and will evolve in the future. New buildings bring the worst reactions and contemporary builds tend to fail on the visual front fir this reason. Everyone tries too hard. There should be more flexibility towards the development of Edinburgh as a city but its history and its politics make this challenging. The commissioning process and even the understanding of what is a public work of art, are also challenging.",
